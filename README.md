# Edit table with RecyclerView
# The table allows each participant to enter a point from 0 to 5. After filling in all the fields of one participant, the sum of his points is calculated. If you enter an invalid number, it turns red and the score is not counted. After filling in the sums of points of all participants, their places are calculated.
